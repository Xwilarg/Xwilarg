## Welcome on my profile!

My name is Christian Chaux and I'm a software developer, mainly doing C# but sometimes a bit of JS/TS and C++\
I also like working on some personal projects on my free time, all of them are on my GitHub (scroll down a bit to see them!)

Aside from programming, I also enjoy playing some video games or reading books, feel free to check [my website](https://zirk.eu/) if you want to know more

### Contact
You can either send me a mail or add me on Discord (either by adding Zirk#0001 or by coming to my [support server](https://discord.gg/H6wMRYV))

## About my projects

### Need help/new feature?
Feel free to open issues on the GitHub page of my projects if you need anything, you can also just contact me if you want to speak directly

Depending of the project I may or not add it (depending of the size of the feature and if I'm still maintaining the project), but hey, you might as well try

### Contributing
I'm accepting pull requests on all my projects, feel free to fork them and add stuff.

### Others
If you want to support me, please star the projects you like!\
If you want to go further, I also have a [GitHub sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/Xwilarg/)

## Footnote
I wish I had more hot color in my "Pinned Projects" section but I guess I'm condemned to use languages that are either green or blue
